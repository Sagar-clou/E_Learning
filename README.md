ðŸ“š E-Learning Description (with Project Mention)

E-learning is a digital method of learning using the internet, videos, and interactive tools. It offers flexible and accessible education from anywhere.
As part of my learning journey, I developed a Quiz Challenge Project to make online learning more engaging and test user knowledge in a fun way.
